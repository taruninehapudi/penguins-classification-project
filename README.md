# penguins-classification-project
Project Overview

• Machine learning project using the seaborn Penguins dataset
• Predicts penguin species based on physical characteristics
• Includes exploratory data analysis, visualization, and ML modeling

Objectives

• Understand relationships between species and features
• Visualize patterns in bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass
• Build machine learning models to classify species
• Evaluate performance using accuracy and classification metrics

Tools Used

• Python
• Pandas
• NumPy
• Seaborn
• Matplotlib
• Scikit-learn
• Jupyter Notebook

Files in This Repository

• penguins_classification.ipynb — Main notebook
• README.md — Project documentation

Dataset Source

• Seaborn built-in dataset: “penguins”
• Automatically loads inside the notebook

Key Insights

• Species show clear separation based on bill length/depth measurements
• Strong correlations exist among some physical features
• Visualizations reveal distinct feature clusters per species
• ML models successfully classify species with high accuracy

Modeling Summary

• Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models evaluated
• Strong predictive performance achieved
• Feature importance highlights key distinguishing features

Scientific Interpretation

• Species classification closely aligns with real-world morphological differences
• Metrics help describe how penguins vary across islands and species
• Patterns match documented biological classifications

How to Run

• Download this repository
• Open the notebook in Jupyter
• Run all cells (dataset loads automatically through seaborn)
